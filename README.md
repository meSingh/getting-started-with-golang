# Getting Started with Golang - WIP

This is a beginners guide to getting started with Golang. When I began to learn Golang, I couldn't find a go-to guide or any proper recommendations, so I decided to do it myself and document everything that I try or learn here also to help others who struggle with the same problem. 

> Please also note that this is a checklist made by someone who is too new to Golang, so if you have any suggestions or recommendations, please do send me a PR, I would love that. 

[ ] [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) - This is probably the best way to start learning Golang, I've read several getting started articles that tells you about the basics but having the tuotorial and the ability to try it out side-by-side is unbeatable.
