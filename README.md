# Getting Started with Golang - WIP

This is a beginners guide to getting started with Golang. When I began to learn Golang, I couldn't find a go-to guide or any proper recommendations, so I decided to do it myself and document everything that I try or learn here also to help others who struggle with the same problem. 

> Please also note that this is a checklist made by someone who is too new to Golang, so if you have any suggestions or recommendations, please do send me a PR, I would love that. 


## Getting Started

 - [ ] [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) - This is probably the best way to start learning Golang, I've read several getting started articles that tells you about the basics but having the tuotorial and the ability to try it out side-by-side is unbeatable. 




### The Maybe's

This is the list of interesting articles that I've not read yet, but I intend to. They might get added to the master list. 

 - [ ] [Golang - Getting Started](https://dev.to/codehakase/golang---getting-started-16c)
 - [ ] [Debugging Simple Memory Leaks in Go](https://medium.com/dm03514-tech-blog/sre-debugging-simple-memory-leaks-in-go-e0a9e6d63d4d)
 

### The Reference List

These are some interesting topics that you can read in your spare time. These are more basically some articles/tutorials on different kind of things that will come handy when you start coding in Golang. 


- [x] [Go's Declaration Syntax](https://blog.golang.org/gos-declaration-syntax) - If you are like me who has any experience with any other language, go declarations look wired and confusing, but once you understand them, they are not that bad.
